This Python code is made to create a music recommendation system based on similarities between songs in a dataset. The program uses a cosine similarity algorithm to calculate how similar one song is to others, based on features like valence, danceability, energy, and more. The user will enter the song title and artist, and the system will recommend songs that are similar to the input song. The programming language used is Python, with libraries like pandas for data processing and TfidfVectorizer from sklearn for text processing. The programmer's skill level is intermediate, as they understand how to use basic machine learning libraries and data manipulation. However, there is room for improvement in handling errors and organizing the code structure more effectively.
